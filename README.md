# Changelog
**Version 1.7.8**
- [x] Fixed FTP transfer: In version 1.7.6 and 1.7.7 (potentially also in older versions) I mistakenly broke the ftp transfer by calling the wrong function (due to some typo). This has been fixed in this version. Thanks to Jas Gujral for spotting this and informing me so I could fix it
- [x] Tested solution on new TufinOS and TOS versions. Thanks to the Tufin Professional Services team for giving feedback on this
- [x] Added functionality to check if user provided paths with or without trailing slashes. Many thanks to [asainsbury](https://github.com/asainsbury)
- [x] Added security related comments to this readme. Many thanks to [TabTwo](https://github.com/TabTwo)

# Tufin Backup Wizard
Automating backups for Tufin Orchestration Suite (TOS Classic only) as well as automatically cleaning up older backups from your backup storage is not a builtin feature in Tufin. This appliaction has been developed to make your life easier and solve some of the most common backup requirements of Tufin customers. The Tufin Backup Wizard enables you to create the backups you intended to create of your Tufin Orchestration Suite. You can setup local Tufin backups as well as backups that get saved to remote servers via FTP and SCP.

When the application is run for the first time it will guide you through the setup process. After the initial setup has been completed, you can create a cronjob that will run the script periodically and by that create your automated local or remote Tufin backups. The wizard will also guide you through the creation of the correct cronjob.

# Disclaimer
Tufin Backup Wizard is a Third-Party solution and is not supported by Tufin itself. Feel free to contribute to this project by sending pull-requests to this repository. If you like to contribute to this project, please create your own branch and name it as the feature you intend to add.

# Tufin Backup Wizard Capabilities
- Create local Tufin backups (create and save backups on your Tufin TOS Classic server)
- Define prefixes for your backup files (usefull if many Tufin servers create backup files within the same directory)
- Automatically delete older backups within your local storage (the script will not remove any files on remote servers)
- Create remote Tufin backups via FTP
- Create remote Tufin backups via SCP

# Prerequisites
A Tufin installation containing TufinOS with TOS (Tufin Orchestration Suite) Classic installed is required. For remote backups make sure that the user has the required permissions to store data on a remote server. The solution hasn't been tested with TOS Aurora, and due to TOS Aurora's new architecture, will most likely fail.

# Quickstart
Simply download the latet copy of the backup wizard and place the file called **backup-wizard.sh** on your Tufin Server:
1. Download the latest copy of **backup-wizard.sh**
2. Place it in the following directory on your Tufin Server: **/usr/local/bin/**
3. Make sure to set the correct owner of the script: **chown root:root /usr/local/bin/backup-wizard.sh**
4. Also make sure to set the correct permissions: **chmod 750 /usr/local/bin/backup-wizard.sh**
5. **Finally:** Run the wizard and follow the instructions: **sh /usr/local/bin/backup-wizard.sh**

**Note:** The wizard will create a configuration file after it was run successfully. The configuration file is located at /usr/local/bin/backup-wizard.cfg by default. This location can be changed within the **backup-wizard.sh** itself. The configuration file is only readable by the root-user so that secret information is hidden for other users.

Once a configuration file exists, the wizard will not be shown again and rerunning **backup-wizard.sh** triggers the backup process with the previously defined backup settings. However using the following options you can show the currently configured settings, rerun the wizard, add or remove cronjobs or completely remove the configuration file.

# CLI optional parameters
- **--help | -h:** View appliactions help information
- **--reconfigure | -r:** Rerun wizard and overwrite the existing backup settings
- **--show-configuration | -s:** Show current backup settings
- **--delete-configuration | -d:** Delete current backup settings including configuration file
- **--add-cronjob | -c:** Create or overwrite an existing cronjob in root users crontab
- **--delete-cronjob | -e:** Erase backup cronjobs that are referenced to this script

**Security Note:** Passwords for remote backups will be stored within the configuration file. It is highly recommended to use ssh-key based authentication and to then provide a dummy-password for the wizard to run successfully. Key-based authentication provides a higher level of security than a password.
